Each day, I'll post my code, notes, and insights as I progress through the challenge. Expect to find a variety of topics covered, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like data visualization and finance-related projects.

Join me on this learning adventure and feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or collaborate on any of the projects. Let's code and grow together! ðŸš€
